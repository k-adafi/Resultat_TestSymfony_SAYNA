# Laravel / Symfony Refactoring Kata Test

## Introduction

**SAYNA** is present in plenty of countries, and we have some message templates we want to send
in different languages. To achieve that, we've developed `TemplateManager` whose job is to replace
placeholders in texts by travel related information.

`TemplateManager` is a class that's been around for years and nobody really knows who coded
it, or how it really works. Nonetheless, as the business changes frequently, this class has
already been modified many times, making it harder to understand at each step.

Today, once again, the PO wants to add some new stuff to it.
But this class is already complex enough, and just adding a new behavior will break the app.

Your mission, should you accept it, is to **refactor `TemplateManager` to make it
understandable by the next developers** and easy to change afterward. Now is the time for you to
show your exceptional abilities and improve this implementation, extensible, and ready for the future
features. Of course, **you have to port all the code to Laravel or Symfony (given the speciality you're applying on SAYNA Work)**.

This exercise **was made to not last longer than 4 hours**, but we know that this can be too short to do it all, and you might take longer if it pleases you. Stop when you feel you've done something you feel comfortable sharing with us. Your task is not to make ALL the application on Laravel/Symfony, we only want you to show off your skills. But keep in mind that your test result will give you your payment level at the end, and that you cannot change that if you screw up the test.

You can run the example file to see the method in action.

## Rules
There are some rules to follow:
 - You must commit regularly
 - Do not change the current app behavior 


## Deliverables
What do we expect from you:
 - the link of the git repository in the tally form you need to fill to submit your application
 - several commits, with an explicit message each time
 - add a readme to explain your process, principles you've followed and the command to use your app

## Test this app
You can test the app with a `make example`

**Good luck!**
